   abstract = {Peatland functions (e.g., carbon sequestration and flora diversity) are largely driven by soil moisture dynamics and thus dependent on interactions between hydrologic regimes and organic soil properties. Understanding these interactions is particularly important in drained peatlands, where drier conditions may alter soil properties with feedbacks to soil water retention and associated ecosystem functions. In this work, we focused on the Great Dismal Swamp (GDS) in Virginia, USA, a historically drained, temperate peatland with ongoing hydrologic restoration efforts. Two distinct soil layers varying in thickness exist at GDS: an upper layer with subangular blocky structure thought to be a result of past drainage, and a sapric lower layer with a massive structure more representative of an undisturbed state. To understand the occurrence and consequences of these distinct layers, we used continuous water table data and analysed soil physical and hydraulic properties to characterize soil profiles at 16 locations. We found significant differences between layer properties, where upper layers had lower fibre and organic matter contents and higher bulk densities. Further, moisture release curves demonstrated lower water retention in upper layers compared with lower layers and key differences in pore structure, with upper layers having higher macroporosity. Upper layers varied in thickness across sampling locations ($0.30 to 1.0 m) with a transition to lower soil layers typically occurring at depths below contemporary water level observations, suggesting that the upper layer may be a result of historical drainage and deeper water table conditions. Yet, upper layers with more frequent saturation exhibited higher water retention and lower macroporosity compared with drier upper layers, thus indicating potential recovery following re-wetting efforts. These findings highlight how past drainage influences soil properties and water retention, with important implications for current management objectives at GDS and other drained peatland systems.},
